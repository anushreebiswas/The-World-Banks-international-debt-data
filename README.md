## Overview

Countries, like individuals, take on debt to finance growth, infrastructure, and development. This project explores **international debt data** collected by **The World Bank**, focusing on the amount of debt owed by developing countries across several debt categories.

The dataset (sourced from **Sayak Paul**) provides figures in USD and spans a wide range of **debt indicators**, helping us understand which countries and categories contribute most to global borrowing.
